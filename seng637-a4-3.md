# Introduction

# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 

# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class

# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing

# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints

# how did you test each functionaity with different test data

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed

The team was organized into three groups for collaborative coding efforts: 1) Aemen & Muiz, 2) Shaun and Fathima, and 3) Soumini. The division of work within the groups is as follows:
  * Shaun and Fathima worked on Mutation Testing for Data Utilities.
  * Soumini worked on Mutation Testing for Data Range class.
  * Muiz and Aemen worked on helping both Data Utilities and Data Range class wherever necessary.
  * Everyone did Selenium Testing

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned
  * One of the main difficulties we had in this assignment was increasing the mutation score by 10%. Often at times we would introduce test cases that would introduce new mutants and increase the individual score of the test class themselves, however, this did not increase the mutation score of the DataUtilities.java or DataRange.java class themselves. In fact most of the times introducing new test cases resulted in the mutation score going down.

# Comments/feedback on the assignment itself
What we...

- **Liked:** We liked Selenium-ide as it was very straightforward and easy to use compared to the web-driver. 
- **Disliked:** We disliked how the Selenium-ide often made the web-page unresponsive when asserting data. This made it difficult to capture all the steps necessary and often required edits to the test-case itself.
- **Found Interesting:** It was interesting running Pitests and seeing the mutations being killed.
- **Found Confusing:** It was confusing how making changes to the test methods does not improve the mutation score of the overall class even though new mutants were introduced to the individual tests method.
- **Found Challenging:** The biggest challenge in this assignment was trying to raise the mutation score by 10%. Often at times it felt like we were shooting in the dark in hopes of increasing our score.
- **Found Motivating:**
